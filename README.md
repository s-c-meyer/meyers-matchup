# Meyer's Matchups

This app is a work in progress but was born from the idea of making it easier to score card games. These games often require a pen and paper to keep score. What happens when you win and you want to be able to rub it in everyone's faces, but that piece of paper was thrown away? That's where Meyer's Matchups comes in! 

## Features
- Keep a database of past scores
- Different pages for different games, designed to make it the easiest to keep score
